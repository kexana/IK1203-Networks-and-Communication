*IK1203 VT25 Networks and Communication at KTH during ICT bsc*

***
The is a course meant to introduce networking, protocols and communication. It tackles the study of how large international networks are constructed from the individual computers, via local area, city and national networks. The Internet is used as the working example of such a network. The aim of the course is to give insights into both the theory and practice of the shere. There is focus in this course on the protocols and algorithms used, and consequently how they are utilized and implemented into the TCP/IP-stack - the basis of the Internet is followed.

## Project Specifics 
The purpose of this assignment was to learn about implementing networking applications – programs that communicate over the network. We had to also learn about how applications and the operating system interact – in terms of the Socket API in this case.

The project consisted of a number of tasks. Each of which building upon the previous in order to reach a final simple working concurrent server application able to service multiple clients at the same time with rudimentary responses.

This assignment was implemented in Java with a key focus on the Socket API.
